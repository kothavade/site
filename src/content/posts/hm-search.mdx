Home Manager Search is a tool which scrapes the [Home Manager manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml) and allows you to search for metadata from a generated index.

For any given option, you can see see detailed information about it, including types, examples, default values, and more.

I wrote a bit about how I use Nix previously, and alluded to how it not only manages my system, but my home directory (in other words, my dotfiles), as well.

This is done through a tool called [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), but the documentation for it is a bit lacking--it's thorough, but it's not very searchable.
I wanted to be able to search for a particular option, and see what it does, and what it's default value is.

So, I wrote a tool to do that. It's built with Next.js 14, styled with Tailwind (with help from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)), and deployed to Vercel.

A GitHub action scrapes the Home Manager manual nightly, so it should always reflect the latest update to Home Manager.
