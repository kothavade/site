CodeSense is a language agnostic code search engine built with SolidJS.
It is inspired by [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/), a Haskell code search engine.

If you're interested in seeing the code after reading this, the repo can be found at: [kothavade/CodeSense](https://github.com/kothavade/CodeSense)

## Purpose

Oftentimes I find that I know what I want from a library, but don't know what it's called.
For example, take [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a popular game development library written in C.

It provides a helpful function called `ColorAlpha`, which is rather aptly named and allows you to set the alpha value of a color.
However, as a new user, I don't know that--I might be thinking in terms of "transparency" or "opacity", and waste time fruitlessly grepping the codebase or <kbd>âŒ˜F</kbd> ing the documentation.
What I do know, though, is that the function I want will likely consume a `Color` and a `float`, and return a `Color`--so why not search for that?

This tool allows you complete the above search with something as simple as `Color, Float -> Color`

## How it works

With CodeSense, you can still search for functions by name, so no need to forget your grepping instincts.
But, if you're looking for something more powerful, use the [Tree-Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) powered semantic search, which allows you to search for functions by their function signature/protoype.

This works by compiling the Tree-Sitter C library, along with the "grammars" for every supported language, to WebAssembly.
Then, `queries`, which are essentially hand-written Lisp S-expressions that describe the AST nodes I'm looking for, are run against ASTs Tree-Sitter generates for source code to build an index.
When you search, I run your search against the index, and show you the results.

### Example Query

    <details>
          <summary>This is the query used for Rust code</summary>

```lisp
(function_item
	name: (identifier) @function_name
    parameters: (parameters
        (
            (parameter
                type: (_) @parameter_type
            )
            ","?
        )*
    )
    return_type: (_) @return_type
) @function_body
```

The `@xyz` syntax represents capture groups, which are used to extract relevant information from the AST.

    </details>

## How to use

1. Go to [CodeSense](https://codesense.kothavade.com)
2. Type in a function name, or a function signature

   * For the example above, you could type in `ColorAlpha` (string-based search), or `Color, Float -> Color` (meaning-based search)
3. You will see a list of matching functions, and you can expand any of them so see their full source code

## Supported Languages

At the moment, CodeSense supports the following languages:

* C
* Rust

It is trivial to add more languages (I just have to write the queries), so if you'd like to see a language added, please open an issue!
The GitHub repo can be found in the header.
